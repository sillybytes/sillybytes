title: Vinfo, alternative to GNU Info documentation reader

The traditional GNU Info program has a 'vi mode', but let's face it, it is just
not good enough; It's very limited and ugly.

There are good alternatives though, as Pinfo but is still not comfortable enough
and lacking most of the Vim power.

There is where *Vinfo* comes in to allow reading Info documentation in Vim so we
have all the power we need to read and explore in such a comfortable way and
with the beauty and power off Vim help-files.

*Vinfo* is a Vim plugin so you can use it right inside a Vim session or from
your shell using the appropriate shell script to trigger it.
