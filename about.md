# About me

Hey! I'm Daniel Campoverde, a systems engineer based in Cuenca, Ecuador.

I develop full stack. Really mean that: from hardware design & firmware
development, to systems programming, all the way up to web & mobile development,
machine & deep learning, pure functional programming and everything in between.
I just love everything that can go *beep beep boop*: electronics, computers,
software, and also like my maths and stats as well.

# Things I do and like

I've being doing this stuff since I can remember, and have used a *ton* of
programming languages, tools, paradigms, and what not; Having had a *taste* for
many things though, I'm really into functional programming, strong/static typed
languages, Vim, command line interfaces, near-metal firmware, native mobile,
*NIX.

Love to write Haskell for most things, including web development, but also enjoy
writing C & Rust for embedded systems and Kotlin & Swift for native mobile
development. Security and system administration on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD too.

Like to make simple illustrations and vector graphics for my projects as well,
not exactly an artist, but a sprinkle of amateur art here and there really makes
things come to life.


## Projects

Have worked on [many
things](https://github.com/alx741?tab=repositories&q=&sort=stargazers), but some
I quite like are:

### The Venabili keyboard

Take a look here: [venabili.sillybytes.net](https://venabili.sillybytes.net).
It's a custom mechanical keyboard developed from the ground up. I use it as my
daily driver and couldn't be happier.

### Dors, the emotional robot
