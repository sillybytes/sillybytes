As a user of the [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/) framework, I've came to know
and love the
[Cassius](https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-8.4/shakespeare-2.0.12.1/Text-Cassius.html#v:cassius)
CSS templating language, although its reliance on Template Haskell is meant to
fit better with the Yesod's needs and makes it a bit cumbersome to use
everywhere else, I still like the templating itself a lot.

That's why I used it for the styles generation for [Silly
Bytes](http://www.sillybytes.net) together with
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). In this post I will describe the
process.
